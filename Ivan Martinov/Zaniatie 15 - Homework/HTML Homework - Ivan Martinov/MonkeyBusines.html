<p>Chimpanzees</p>

<p>The chimpanzees are divided in four groups. The Nursery Group consists of Lulu and several young chimpanzees including Bryan, a rescue from Cancun, Mexico. The group's leader Sally passed away in 2018.

Alpha male Butch leads the Bachelor Boys, an all-male group. One of its most famous residents was named Charlie, rescued by Cronin from a beach photographer in Spain who was using the chimp as a prop.

Paddy's Group (now led by Cindy) and Hananya's Group are both family groups. Bart is the youngest in Paddy's group. The internal politics within these groups determine how long each male is leader.</p>

<p>Orangutans</p>

<p>There are three orangutan groups. Tuan's Group, Gordon's Group and the Nursery Group, looked after by a foster mother known as Roro. All of the orangutans are part of the international breeding program.</p>

<p>Other primates</p>

<p>The other 14 species include woolly monkeys, capuchins, squirrel monkeys, marmosets, cotton-top tamarins, siamang gibbons, golden-cheeked gibbons and other gibbons.

Monkey World is part of the international species breeding program for golden-cheeked gibbons, orangutans and woolly monkeys.</p>
